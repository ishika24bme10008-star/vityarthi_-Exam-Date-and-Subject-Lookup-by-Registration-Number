*Problem Statement:
The problem to be addressed through this project is the difficulty students face in quickly accessing accurate and personalized exam schedules based on their registration numbers. Currently, students may have to manually search through generalized timetables that do not directly link their academic branch and registration details to their specific subjects and exam dates. This leads to confusion, inefficiency, and the risk of missing critical exam information, ultimately affecting student preparation and performance.

*Project Scope:
This project aims to build a simple, console-based application that links student registration number prefixes to their academic branches and provides clear, personalized exam schedules including subjects, dates, and timings. The scope includes supporting multiple branches with branch-specific subjects and ensuring user-friendly input and output. The project focuses on fundamental data mapping and retrieval without a complex database backend, suitable for academic demonstration purposes.

*Target Users:
The primary users of this system are students enrolled in various academic branches, such as Mechanical, Computer Science, and Aerospace Engineering, who need quick access to their personalized exam schedule. Secondary users include academic staff who may use the tool to verify exam schedules or assist students. The application is tailored for educational institutions with well-defined registration number schemes linking to branches and subjects.

*High-Level Features:

1.Input student branch prefix (from registration number) to retrieve exam schedules.

2.Display subject names along with exam dates and timings personalized for each branch.

3.Support for multiple branches with distinct subject schedules.

4.Case-insensitive matching of branch prefixes for ease of use.

5.Clear console output for straightforward interaction.

6.Graceful handling of invalid or unsupported branch inputs.
